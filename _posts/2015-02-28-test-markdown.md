To me Data Science is a journey.  A chance to boldy go forth and find solutions to problems that need to be solved.  Alchemy, in the medivial times was a precursor of sorts to modern day chemistry (mixed with a bit of mysticism) but the basic principle was to turn base metals or raw materials into gold or special elixirs.  More specifically it was a science to take these raw materials and turn them into something useful.  Here is where my metaphor begins to bloom;  Data Science is the art/science of taking raw data and turning it into actionable information or intelligence.  Its taking something worthless and turning it into something valuable.
