<a href="https://medium.com/@randomwalkjm/ghosts-in-the-machine-3d0115c065f6">In 1930 Einstein did what he does best. He stumbled upon a  peculiarity of quantum particles that he dubbed "Spooky Action".  He also was quick to dismiss the properties of these particles as nonsense.
Thus beginning a decades long squabble among the physics community. A Battle between Einstein and Bohr.  In 1964 the truth of the matter came to light, through photons that is.  There was finally proof of quantum entanglement.
Entanglement  involves a pair of particles linked by the strange quantum property  where two particles are so deeply linked that they share the same existence. It is these particles, their superposition, and their properties of entanglement that, if controlled correctly, can usher in a new information age.
This post will uncover some of the curious nature of entanglement and superposition.</a>
