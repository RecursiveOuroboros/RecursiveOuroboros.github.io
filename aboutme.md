PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE – LOGIC, MATHEMATICS, PROGRAMMING
Triangulum, LLC | Washington, DC	            		January 2019 – Present | Founder, Data Scientist, Consultant
Blue Morpho Strategies | Washington, DC     	 	Jun 2016 – Present   Founder | Data Scientist, Consultant 
•	Developed and delivered high-end custom algorithmic based solutions to a select high net worth client base by using advanced data mining techniques refined over the years in my various other positions and developing programs that would identify arbitrage opportunities to execute wealth building strategies through high frequency options trading.  
•	Data Analysis and Data mining of financial markets. Providing expertise on data storage structures, data mining, and data cleansing. Used Python generated algorithms to identify low risk high opportunity investments. (Arbitrage) based on pricing parity.  
•	Trained Neural Networks and Machine Learning nodes using KNN, Regression, SVM, One-Hot Encoding. And Principal Component Analysis and to predict future of market activities and to activate automated trading.  Specifically, trained RNN Models to trade Volatility in the options markets. 
 Loudon County Virginia | Washington, DC     		 May 2014 – Mar 2016 Chief Investment Officer| Deputy Treasurer 
•	Developed algorithmic models to maximize risk parameters over return parameters in order to make the most informed risk adjusted investments for the county with the least amount of lost opportunity cost over 1,2,5, and 10-year tranches. Using basic logistic regressions generated Booleans and then used multivariate analysis to determine if the investment was good based on duration, convexity, yield, and risk. 
 Janney Montgomery Scott | Washington, DC     		  Nov 2012 – May 2014 Quantitative Equity Portfolio Manager 
•	Was hired to convert a $250 MM Mutual Fund book to inhouse automated decision-making platform to increase ROI for the company and decrease cost structure for the clients.
•	Developed structured backend databases and used portfolio decisions to run simulations in order to refine and tune algorithmic decision making.  Ultimately creating a system like European Football leagues of Promotion and Relegation of orders to execute based on prior history success or failure using logistic regression models.  (Progress was frustratingly disrupted by changes in company regulations)
 Morgan Stanley | Washington, DC       			Jan 2009 – November 2012 Quantitative Equity Portfolio Manager
•	Worked on Machine Learning Systems that sought to understand human behavior and trading behavior with RNNs. 
•	developed scripted software that sought to interpret financial markets upcoming behavior patterns using past performance and inferences from numerical interpretations of Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory.   
Shepard & Vrbanac Securities | Akron, OH     		Jan 2006 – Jan 2011 Vice President | Head of Trading 
•	Primary job was to develop and deploy data mining techniques running back 50 years for the S&P500 and train models for pattern recognition.  Then I was to cross train this data and compare it to SPX and OIX options series and generate a learning model in order to train the data into a neural network that would activate high frequency trading when arbitrage (no-risk) opportunities were available.
Capitol Financial Partners | Washington, DC      		Feb 2003 – Jan 2006 	Quant 
•	Text mining and data wrangling of commodities, equities, currencies, and derivative financial markets.  Used analysis to make trading decisions for private clients. 
•	Advanced Quantitative Financial Analysis of Markets and Trading of Capital Assets
